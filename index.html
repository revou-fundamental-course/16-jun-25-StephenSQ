                    <p>A project assignment from the RevoU team, Software Engineering Fundamental Course, where we are
                        asked
                        to create a Mathematical Triangle Calculator Website with the design below :</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Well ... As you can see this is not quite according to the design specifications. To be fair we
                        do
                        have the priviledge to design as we please according to the

                        As long as we include the required features mentioned. Indeed I intend to obey them... until...
                        I
                        think I no longer do... it is stated 1 CSS file for the entirety of the project but clearly
                        there's
                        too much happening here already, fitting all the styling to one index.css file makes it
                        unreadable
                        and my OCD will kill me if I do so.
                    </p>

                    <p>"Hey this is so overkill dude are you flexing or smth ?" Well hol up, hear me out, I must say I
                        do
                        have experience in web design and programming in general but not yet to the professional extent.
                        But
                        during the hustle n bustle with High School I stopped making projects like this and only till
                        recently I finally returned to this side of my long abandoned hobby. I did not intend to show
                        off a
                        full fledged website but I do enjoy this course, so naturally I got carried away to continue
                        where I
                        left off my personal website design as I make this calculator project.</p>

                    <p>I've forgotten a lot of the CSS properties and JS syntax, thanks to RevoU's course and team they
                        did
                        a pretty great job at teaching us the basics n stuff, and I regained that lost knowledge thanks
                        to
                        them. Not to mention git, I'm no fluent version control user and RevoU also happens to teach us
                        that
                        from the beginning since git is BIG in the techsavvy-professional-world. I'm taking on a CS
                        Undergraduate degree so I wouldnt need their full stack course but I sure hope RevoU can truly
                        provide high-quality education on modern programming to a lot of people.</p>

                    <p>Ok that's enough yapping without further ado, you can go click that calculator tab or smth.
                        Thanks if u somehow read all the way here lmao.</p>

                    <p>Hey this website is free for yall to check the source code in the github repository if ya'll
                        wanna
                        check out the goofy ahh tricks I use to make these. I'm the creator of this website but of
                        course
                        this wouldn't be possible without the assistance of "clever Research and Troubleshooting tools"
                        to
                        help me efficiently learn how to actually make things work and fix the MANY unexpected problems
                        I
                        have to encounter along the way.</p>

                    <p>By "clever Research and Troubleshooting tools" I bet you can pretty much guess what I meant by
                        that.
                        But I wouldnt wanna spend days reading documents of the programming language with technical
                        terms
                        99% I've never heard of. Courses take time too to follow through and I only wanna join the one's
                        I
                        trust to actually be able to teach properly. One should never blatantly copy paste code too, I
                        use
                        these tools to literally learn how the code works and how to use it and I implement and
                        integrate
                        that to my website myself.</p>
